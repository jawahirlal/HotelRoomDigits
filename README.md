# HotelRoomDigits
This implementation assumes that we are building a hotel with a huge number of rooms. Each room needs brass numbers denoting its number; 1 through to the maximum number of rooms. It works out how many brass digits of each number you will need. For example, room 1001 needs 2 “1” digits and 2 “0” digits.


Function GenerateDigits(int numberRoomsReq) generates the brass digits for each number given the maximum number of rooms (N).
